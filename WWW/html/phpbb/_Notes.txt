Webhost will need to install phpbb.
It will use a database, probably want to create and use a separate one?
Files might need to be chmod to 751 (I think...)

Can set a remote DB Server/Hostname IF we get remote access to the DB itself working...
Adjust Domain Name? to ipadd/phpbb???

once installed delete or rename install directory..
