Copied from <https://github.com/robfacella/rabbitmqphp_example> on 2/24/2019
which is a modified fork of <https://github.com/engineerOfLies/rabbitmqphp_example>

There is probably a better way to incorporate the git repo into this one but for now this will have to do. Please correct me if you know a better way that doesn't require switching to working directly off of the fork and setting up all collaborator permissions again.
