sudo apt-get install mysql-server

#Going to ask you to choose a root password or leave blank. I don't think DJ wants us working on the database as root (everything through rabbitmq and all) so I just set mine to: root
#For secured installation do:
###systemctl restart mysql
###mysql_secure_installation
#Not sure what that affects but making a note of it.

mysql -u username -p password
