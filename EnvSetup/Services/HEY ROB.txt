Put the edited service files here: /etc/systemd/system

Then, enter the following commands:

systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable bpocgitinstall.service
systemctl start bpocgitinstall.service

for the Rabbit service, also add:

systemctl enable bpocrabbit.service
systemctl start bpocrabbit.service

use (systemctl status bpocgitinstall.service) and/or (systemctl status bpocrabbit.service) to make sure they're running.
