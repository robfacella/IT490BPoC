Connected to NAT by default. Need to connect to the Router VIA the Bridged Adapter and get a StaticIP Addr for each Server.

Rob - For my VirtualBox, these interface names were used by default:
enp0s3
enp0s8

enp0s3 - Is the NAT interface on VBox Network Interface 1
enp0s8 - Is the Bridged interface on VBox Network Interface 2

Need to configure the Bridged Interface to:
-Load on Boot
-Connect to the Router
-Attempt to obtain a static IP Addr


Your Mileage may vary.
