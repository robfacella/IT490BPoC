Server Ubuntu should have git preinstalled.
Steps for setting up a server install in general:

Keep default settings during installation and set the NAT interface as the default network connection.
Save some time, no real need to encrypt home directory for these prototyping machines.

1) git clone https://github.com/robfacella/IT490BPoC
2) Run "GeneralInstallSetup.sh"

3) Determine a Static IP for this machine's Bridged Network Interface.
      This will be based on the Server's Cluster and Role.
4) Edit GeneralServerSetup/AddSecondInterfaceInfo.sh appropriately
5) Run AddSecondInterface.sh to add the bridged connection to the Server.
