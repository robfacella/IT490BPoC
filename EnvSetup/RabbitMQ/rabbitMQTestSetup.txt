#DON'T CLUSTER RABBITMQ. Yea, we're a cluster, but no we won't need to construct one of such a scale. K.I.S.S.

RabbitMQ users, vhosts, exchanges etc are ALL CASE-SensitIVE!!!!


If you send a message through a rabbitMQ testclient, without the testServer running, the message is available and viewable from the web interface (localhost/15672), the client sending the message will hang though; opening a test server with the hanging client does resolve the message as expected. Neat?

#Backup to: rabbitmq.config
rabbitmqadmin export rabbit.definitions.json

#import the configuration definitions (quietly)
rabbitmqadmin -q import rabbit.definitions.json


Create vhost with curl, get the vhosts, delete it again
  curl -i -u test:test -H "content-type:application/json" -XPUT http://localhost:15672/api/vhosts/foobar

  curl -i -u test:test -H "content-type:application/json" -X GET "http://localhost:15672/api/overview"

  curl -i -u test:test -H "content-type:application/json" -XDELETE http://localhost:15672/api/vhosts/foobar
