# Brilliant Picks of Cinema

The function of our project is to allow users to create a profile keeping track of the movies they have seen, and allow for better discovery of new movies. While data and algorithms can come up with decent suggestions for what to watch, and movie reviews are generally helpful to get a feel for a film, each viewer has their own taste. If a friend likes the same films as you, they're more likely to give suggestions for films they've seen, that one might not expect.

Brilliant Picks of Cinema attempts to find users with similar tastes in movies to what you have, and using the movies they've seen, suggest new movies close to what you enjoy.

Users should be able to register their own account, enter the movies they've seen, and then get a suggestion for the new movie to watch. Each movie has its own page, with a section for forum discussion inside them.
